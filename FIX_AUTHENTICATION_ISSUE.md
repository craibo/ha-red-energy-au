# Fix for Authentication Issue #5

## Problem Analysis

The user reported getting the error: "No access token available. This typically indicates invalid credentials or client_id."

**Root Cause Identified:**

The issue was in the authentication flow design in `config_flow.py`:

1. `test_credentials()` was only testing the Okta session token acquisition (first step of OAuth2)
2. It was **NOT** completing the full OAuth2 PKCE flow to get the access token
3. When `get_customer_data()` was called later, it required an access token via `_ensure_valid_token()`
4. Since no access token was ever acquired, this failed with "No access token available"

## Authentication Flow Comparison

**Standalone API (working):**
1. Get Okta session token ✅
2. Complete OAuth2 authorization ✅  
3. Exchange code for access token ✅
4. Use access token for API calls ✅

**Integration (broken):**
1. `test_credentials()`: Get Okta session token ✅
2. **MISSING**: OAuth2 authorization and token exchange ❌
3. `get_customer_data()`: Try to use non-existent access token ❌

## Fix Applied

Changed `test_credentials()` method in `api.py`:

**Before:**
```python
async def test_credentials(self, username: str, password: str, client_id: str) -> bool:
    # Just test getting session token without full OAuth flow
    session_token, expires_at = await self._get_session_token(username, password)
    return True
```

**After:**
```python
async def test_credentials(self, username: str, password: str, client_id: str) -> bool:
    # Perform full authentication to get access token
    return await self.authenticate(username, password, client_id)
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added detailed logging to `_ensure_valid_token()` to show token status
2. **Success Logging**: Added confirmation when authentication completes successfully 
3. **Debug Information**: Show token expiration times for troubleshooting

## Expected Result

After this fix:
- `test_credentials()` will complete the full OAuth2 PKCE flow
- Access token will be properly acquired and stored
- `get_customer_data()` and `get_properties()` will succeed
- Integration setup will complete successfully

## Testing

The fix ensures that if credentials work with the standalone API, they will also work with the Home Assistant integration, since both now use the same complete authentication flow.
