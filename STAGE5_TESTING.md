## Testing Stage 5

### Step 1: Verify New Components Installation

Check that all new Stage 5 files are present:

```bash
ls custom_components/red_energy/
```

**Expected new files:**
- `device_manager.py` - Device registry enhancements
- `performance.py` - Performance optimization system
- `state_manager.py` - State management and restoration
- `error_recovery.py` - Error recovery and circuit breakers
- `config_migration.py` - Configuration validation and migration

### Step 2: Run Enhanced Test Suite

```bash
pytest tests/test_stage5_enhancements.py -v
```

**Expected Results:**
- All Stage 5 enhancement tests should pass
- Verification of new component structure
- Integration testing with existing components
- Backward compatibility validation

### Step 3: Test Configuration Migration

1. **Automatic Migration Test**:
   - Remove and re-add the integration
   - Configuration should automatically migrate to version 3
   - Check logs for migration success messages

2. **Manual Migration Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check current config version in .storage/core.config_entries
   grep -A 5 "red_energy" .storage/core.config_entries
   ```

### Step 4: Performance Monitoring

1. **Enable Performance Monitoring**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Red Energy**
   - Click **Configure** → **Advanced Options**
   - Enable "Performance Monitoring" (should be enabled by default)

2. **Monitor Performance Metrics**:
   - Check coordinator performance: timing, success rates, cache hits
   - Verify memory optimization is working for large datasets
   - Test bulk processing with multiple properties

### Step 5: Device Management Enhancements

1. **Verify Enhanced Device Organization**:
   - Check **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Red Energy** → **Devices**
   - Devices should have improved organization and information
   - Verify device model reflects actual services (e.g., "Dual Service Monitor")

2. **Test Device Diagnostics**:
   - Click on a Red Energy device
   - Go to **Device Info** → **Diagnostics**
   - Should show comprehensive device and entity information

3. **Test Entity Cleanup**:
   - Remove a property from configuration
   - Orphaned entities should be automatically cleaned up
   - Check logs for cleanup operations

### Step 6: State Management and Restoration

1. **Test State Persistence**:
   - Note current sensor values
   - Restart Home Assistant
   - Verify entities restore to last known states quickly
   - Advanced sensors should maintain their calculated values

2. **Test Availability Management**:
   - Simulate network issues (disconnect internet briefly)
   - Entities should show "unavailable" temporarily
   - When connection restores, entities should recover automatically
   - Check logs for availability management activities

3. **State History Verification**:
   - Entity states should be tracked in storage
   - Long-term state history maintained for diagnostics
   - Old history automatically cleaned up (30+ days)

### Step 7: Error Recovery Testing

1. **Test API Connection Recovery**:
   ```yaml
   # In Developer Tools -> Services
   service: red_energy.refresh_data
   data: {}
   ```
   - If API fails, should automatically retry with backoff
   - Fallback to cached data if available
   - Circuit breaker should engage after multiple failures

2. **Test Authentication Recovery**:
   - Simulate auth failure (temporary bad credentials)
   - System should attempt credential refresh
   - Should notify user of persistent auth issues
   - Recovery should be automatic when credentials valid again

3. **Error Statistics Monitoring**:
   - Check coordinator performance metrics
   - Error recovery statistics should be tracked
   - Circuit breaker states should be monitored

### Step 8: Bulk Processing Performance

1. **Multi-Property Setup**:
   - Configure multiple properties (if available)
   - Enable multiple services per property
   - System should process updates in batches

2. **Performance Verification**:
   - Updates should complete faster with bulk processing
   - Memory usage should be optimized
   - No timeout errors with large datasets

### Step 9: Advanced Diagnostics

1. **Integration Health Check**:
   - System should provide comprehensive health metrics
   - Performance statistics available in diagnostics
   - Memory usage and optimization stats
   - Error recovery effectiveness metrics

2. **System Health Monitoring**:
   - Check persistent notifications for health alerts
   - Verify automatic health recovery actions
   - Monitor system performance over time

## Troubleshooting Stage 5

**Performance monitoring not showing data**: Enable in integration options under Advanced Settings

**State restoration not working**: Check storage permissions and available disk space

**Bulk processing not engaging**: Requires 2+ properties; single property uses optimized single processing

**Error recovery not activating**: Check error thresholds; some errors may require manual intervention

**Device diagnostics empty**: Ensure entities are created and have been updated at least once

**Migration failing**: Check Home Assistant logs for specific migration errors; integration will continue functioning

**Memory optimization not effective**: Large datasets may take several update cycles to optimize

**Circuit breakers staying open**: Check underlying connection issues; manual refresh may be needed

## Production Deployment Notes

- Monitor performance metrics after deployment
- Error recovery settings may need tuning based on network environment
- State restoration requires adequate storage space for history
- Bulk processing scales well but monitor API rate limits
- Configuration migration is automatic but test in development first
